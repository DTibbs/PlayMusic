#####INFO:  
  This Rainmeter skin is one that I, as a longtime GPM user,  have been looking for myself for a very long time.  
  It displays the Title, Artist, and Album of the current song being played, accompanied by the Album Artwork.  
  The skin also displays the current status of both the "shuffle" and "repeat" features.  
  Currently, the skin's features are fairly limited. Although keep an eye out for updates, as I will surely be   
  adding more features soon.

#####INSTRUCTIONS:  
  
***GPMDP Setup:***  
  This skin requires you have GPMDP installed to function properly.  
  If not, you can download it here: [Google Play Desktop Player](http://www.googleplaymusicdesktopplayer.com/)   
  After installation, you must also ensure that Playback API is enabled in the *Desktop Settings*, as shown in the image below. 
  This allows GPMDP to interface with external applications.   
  
***Skin Setup:***  
  In order to use this skin, you must change the *#USERNAME#*  variable within the chosen ".ini" file, to fit the username for your computer.   
  (ie *"C:\Users\\#USERNAME#\"*)
