#####INFO:  
  This Rainmeter skin is one that I, as a longtime GPM user,  have been looking for myself for a very long time.  
  It displays the Title, Artist, Album, and Album Artwork of the current song being played, as well as the current  
  status of both the *shuffle* and *repeat* features.  
  Currently, the skin's features are fairly limited. Although keep an eye out for updates, as I will surely be   
  adding more features soon.

#####INSTRUCTIONS:  
  
***GPMDP Setup:***  
  This skin requires you have GPMDP installed to function properly.  
  If not, you can download it here: [Google Play Desktop Player](http://www.googleplaymusicdesktopplayer.com/)   
  After installation, you must also ensure that Playback API is enabled in the *Desktop Settings*, as shown in the image below. 
  This allows GPMDP to interface with external applications.   
  
***Skin Setup:***  
  *Modification no longer necessary to configure the skin file.*
