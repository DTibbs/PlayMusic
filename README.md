<br>

  This [Rainmeter] skin provides [Google Play Music] users the ability to access their active media tastefully on their desktop. Featuring three variants, this skin displays the Album Artwork, accompanied by the Title, Artist, and Album of the song being played, as well as the status of both the *shuffle* and *repeat* features.  
  Additionally, this skin also includes a variety of supplementary features including a customizable visualizer, scalability, as well as volume control and minimization functionalities.

#### In Progress:  
  * Add requested support for Spotify as well as other media players  
  * Improve element color adaptability for light and dark album artwork   
  * Add performance and further customization to visualizer  
<br>

***Note:***&nbsp; Due to current limitations, it's not yet possible to integrate remote control of GPMDP into the skin, though a feature request has been made to the developers and I believe this functionality can be expected in future updates.  
<br>

<img title="" alt="Setup" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16360374/22623801/9bb2ef5e-eb1c-11e6-82d8-de36d27c7d5e.png" width="900" />  
<br>

  This skin requires you have **[Google Play Music Desktop Player]** installed to function properly.  
  After installation, you must also enable *Playback API* in GPMDP's Desktop Settings, shown in the image below, as this allows GPMDP to interface with external applications.

<br>

### Variants  
  *PlayMusic* features square, round, and landscape variants, which in conjunction with its added scalability settings, guarantee its ability to compliment any desktop layout.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

### Settings Menu
  In order to facilitate easy customization, *PlayMusic* includes a highly intuitive settings menu, making configuration and modification a breeze. This menu will be launched upon installation, though it can also be accessed at any time by pressing the &nbsp;<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16360374/21559428/fe6a3654-ce00-11e6-8d2c-ba8570e3132c.png" height="12">&nbsp; on any of the skin variants.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

### Accent Colors
  The addition of selectable accent colors allows users to add a splash of color to their skin, while also allowing *PlayMusic* to tastefully adapt to any theme, layout, or wallpaper.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

### Visualizer
  In addition to providing added functionality to the skin, the recent adoption of a highly customizable visualizer also allows one more way of making this skin your own.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

### Minimization  
  By default, the skin displays a <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16360374/18604473/f2c1e336-7c31-11e6-94f9-a3dc17840435.png" height="25"/>  icon whenever *GPMDP* is inactive, conserving useful desktop space while also serving as a convenient launcher for the application. Though this functionality, as well as the displayed icon can be modified or disabled in the settings menu.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
### Volume control
  This skin also features the ability to easily adjust your computers volume by scrolling up or down on the mouse-wheel with your cursor over the skin.
