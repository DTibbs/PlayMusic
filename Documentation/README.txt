INFO:
  
This Rainmeter skin is one that I have been looking for, as a Google Play Music user for a long time.  
Though more features are being developed constantly, the skin currently displays the Title, Artist, 
Album, and Album Artwork of the song that's currently being played, as well as the status of both the 
shuffle and repeat features.

INSTRUCTIONS:

**GPMDP Setup:**
  This skin requires you have Google Play Music Desktop Player installed to function properly. 
  If not, you can download it [here](http://www.googleplaymusicdesktopplayer.com/).   
  You must also ensure that *Playback API* is enabled in GPMDP's Desktop Settings, shown in the image 
  below. As this allows GPMDP to interface with external applications.
