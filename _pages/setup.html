				  <h2>Setting up Google Play Music Desktop Player</h2>
				  <p>For this skin to function properly, you must first install <strong><a href="https://googleplaymusicdesktopplayer.com" target="_blank">Google Play Music Desktop Player</a></strong>.
				  After installation, you then need to navigate to the applications <em><strong>Desktop Settings</strong></em>, where you must then ensure that "<em>Enable Playback API</em>" and "<em>Enable JSON API</em>" are selected, as featured in the image below.</p>

				  <h2>Authorizing the GPMDP Rainmeter plugin</h2>
				  <p>While the inclusion of media controls into PlayMusic has been requested since the initial release, remote functionalities have been impossible until the recent release of <strong><a href="https://github.com/tjhrulz/GPMDP-Plugin" target="_blank">GPMDP-Plugin</a></strong> by <a href="https://github.com/tjhrulz/GPMDP-Plugin" target="_blank">tjhrulz</a>, which cleverly uses the GPMDP web-socket to allow remote control of the application. Though, in order for the plugin to work properly, the user must provide an four-digit authorization code obtained via the GPMDP application. To make this process as easy as straightforward as possible, a supplementary authorization skin has been included in PlayMusic, featuring a prompt that provides confirmation of the authorization state.</p>

				  <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
				  <p>If you run into any issues throughout the setup proces, I would first suggest refreshing the skin and/or relaunching the GPMDP application. Though, if the problem persists, feel free to open an issue <strong><a href="https://github.com/JonSn0w/PlayMusic/issues/new" target="_blank">here</a></strong>.<br/>
          Also, if you have an issue during the authentication process of the GPMDP plugin, I would suggest that you visit the <i>Troubleshooting</i> page of the <strong><a href="https://github.com/tjhrulz/GPMDP-Plugin/wiki/Troubleshooting" target="_blank">GPMDP-Plugin wiki</a></strong>.</p><br/>
