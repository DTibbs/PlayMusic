			<section id-"q1" class="questions">
				<h4>Why do some of the settings in the settings menu require the skin to be refreshed to show up and some of them don't?</h4>
				<p class="answers">This is do to the frequency that particular settings are updated and the way that each setting has been implemented, though I've done my best to postfix each setting that requires a refresh with a <strong>*</strong>.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="q2" class="questions">
				<h4>Can the skin automatically transition between using Spotify and Google Play Music?</h4>
				<p class="answers">Currently, the skin does not have this functionality, given the issues that may arise when both applications are open, even if only one application is actively playing music. Nevertheless, if enough interest is shown in this feature, it may be added in a future release.</p>

			<section id="q3" class="questions">
				<h4>Is it possible that this skin is interfering with other Rainmeter media player skins?</h4>
				<p class="answers">It is possible that if you are using two GPMDP or Spotify skins, that there may be some interference due to all measures sharing the same cover and default cover location. Developers are aware of these issues, although since occasions where users want to use two skins with similar functionalities are rare, this issue may or may not be addressed in the future. Though, if you are a user that has this issue, feel free to share your interest by submitting an issue <strong><a href="https://github.com/JonSn0w/PlayMusic/issues/new" target="_blank">here</a></strong>.</p>
